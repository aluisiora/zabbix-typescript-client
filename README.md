# Zabbix API Client for NodeJS And Browsers

This is a Zabbix API Client for NodeJS and Browsers written in Typescript to interact with a Zabbix Server using the API methods.

## Getting started

Install this lib with npm:

```bash
npm install --save zabbix-client
```

All parameters used within this lib can be found in the [Zabbix API documentation itself](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/api).

Parameters like `jsonrpc`, `id` and etc are abstracted within this lib.

## Usage examples

Creating the object then logging in:

```javascript
const { ZabbixClient } = require("zabbix-client");

// No calls are made here yet
const client = new ZabbixClient("http://company.com/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php");

// A token will be fetched and saved for further use
const api = await client.login("theusername", "thepassword");
```

After the login, we get an `api` object which is an instance of `ZabbixAPI` class that enables us to call other zabbix methods as we wish, you can find all methods in the [Zabbix API Methods reference](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/api/reference).

Let's get the api info:

```javascript
const { ZabbixClient } = require("zabbix-client");

const client = new ZabbixClient("http://company.com/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php");

const api = await client.login("theusername", "thepassword");

const version = await api.method("apiinfo.version").call();

console.log(version); // 4.0.0
```

The raw response from zabbix is abstracted and only the `result` is returned by the `call` method.

In case we need to call a method and send params with it (example taken from [this](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/api/reference/host/create) zabbix documentation page):

```javascript
const hosts = await api.method("host.create").call({
    host: "Linux server",
    interfaces: [
        {
            type: 1,
            main: 1,
            useip: 1,
            ip: "192.168.3.1",
            dns: "",
            port: "10050"
        }
    ],
    groups: [
        {
            groupid: "50"
        }
    ],
    templates: [
        {
            templateid: "20045"
        }
    ],
    macros: [
        {
            macro: "{$USER_ID}",
            value: "123321"
        }
    ],
    inventory_mode: 0,
    inventory: {
        macaddress_a: "01234",
        macaddress_b: "56768"
    }
});

console.log(hosts); // { hostids: ["107819"] }
```

In case of an error during the call, an instance of `ZabbixResponseException` will be thrown, so if you are using async/await, you can catch it like this:

```javascript
try {
    const result = api.method("thismethod.doesnotexist").call();
} catch (err) {
    err instanceof ZabbixResponseException; // true
    console.log(err.message); // Incorrect method "thismethod.doesnotexist"
}

// It is also thrown if login fails
try {
    const api = client.login("wrongusername", "wrongpassword");
} catch (err) {
    err instanceof ZabbixResponseException; // true
    console.log(err.message); // Login name or password is incorrect.
}
```

Or else, just do a then/catch:

```javascript
api.method("thismethod.doesnotexist")
    .call()
    .then(result => {
        // the result, but this will fail
    })
    .catch(err => {
        err instanceof ZabbixResponseException; // true
        console.log(err.message); // Incorrect method "thismethod.doesnotexist"
    });
```

## Note

Remember to always logout after you finish using the api:

```javascript
await api.logout();
```
